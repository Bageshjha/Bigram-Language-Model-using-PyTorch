# Bigram-Language-Model-using-PyTorch
This repository contains an implementation of a Bigram Language Model built using PyTorch. The model generates text based on input sequences from a corpus (in this case, the text of The Wizard of Oz). The model is trained to predict the next character in a sequence of characters, which allows it to generate novel text after training.
